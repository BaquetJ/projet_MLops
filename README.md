# Data Science Workflow

This project demonstrates a data science workflow with the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and transforming features for modeling.
3. **Modeling**: Training and evaluating machine learning models.

## Files
- `data_preparation_job.py`: Script for data preparation.
- `feature_engineering_job.py`: Script for feature engineering.
- `modeling_job.py`: Script for model training and evaluation.
- `requirements.md`: List of dependencies.

## How to Run
1. Run `data_preparation_job.py` to clean the data.
2. Run `feature_engineering_job.py` to engineer features.
3. Run `modeling_job.py` to train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements
See `requirements.md` for the list of dependencies.
